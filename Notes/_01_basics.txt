----- What is react ? ----------

React is a javascript library used to build user interfaces. It is one of the most popular UI libraries. It has a component based architecture.

Components

Root (App) Component -> contains all other component. A component is a code inside a JavaScript file.

They are of two types
1. function Components
2. Class Components

Function Components

The function components are literally JavaScript functions which returns some HTML code

Default and named exports in React Components

Default exports allow you to export a single value from a module as the default export. This means that when importing the module, you can choose any name you want to refer to that default exported value

eg- default export

// MyComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // Component logic here
};

export default MyComponent;

from the above component we can import MyComponent by some other name too


import MyComponentname2 from './MyComponent';


eg - named import


// MyComponent.js
import React from 'react';

export const ComponentA = () => {
  // Component A logic here
};

export const ComponentB = () => {
  // Component B logic here
};

given below is how to import from named import

import { ComponentA, ComponentB } from './MyComponent';


What is JSX? 

JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension syntax for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. It is primarily used with React to describe the structure and content of React components.

JSX resembles HTML but is actually closer to JavaScript. It provides a concise and familiar syntax for defining the structure of UI components, making it easier to visualize and understand the component's structure and hierarchy.

JSX differences

Class -> className
for -> htmlFor

camelCase property naming convention
1. onclick -> onclick
2. tabindex -> tabIndex
